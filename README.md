### Hi there!

I'm a hobbyist programmer with a career in aerospace manufacturing.

I don't play Minecraft any more really, but I'm still active in the Spigot plugin development scene. In addition to [my own repositories](https://github.com/Jikoo?tab=repositories) I maintain [OpenInv](https://github.com/lishid/OpenInv) and frequently contribute to [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention).
