### Hi there!

I'm a programmer with a career in CNC manufacturing. My focus is on Java, but I can work my way through other languages with relative ease as the need arises. I've worked with Bash, various SQL/NoSQL databases (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.), and dabbled in Python, C#, and more. I can write G-code manually when required, optimizing or redefining tool paths and programs. I've also done systems administration for several communities I helped manage over the years.

I don't play Minecraft much any more, but I'm still active in the Spigot plugin development scene. In addition to [my own repositories](https://github.com/Jikoo?tab=repositories) I maintain [OpenInv](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv), frequently contribute to [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention), and collaborate on [Treasury](https://github.com/lokka30/Treasury).
