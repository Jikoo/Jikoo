### Hi there!

I'm a prospective software engineer with a background in aerospace manufacturing. The majority of my work is in Java, but I can work my way through other languages with relative ease as the need arises. I've worked with Bash, various SQL/NoSQL databases (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.), and dabbled in Kotlin, Python, C/C++, and more. I can write G-code manually when required, optimizing or redefining tool paths and programs. I've also done systems administration for several communities I helped manage over the years.

I maintain [OpenInv](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv) and collaborate on [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/GriefPrevention/GriefPrevention) in addition to [my own projects](https://github.com/Jikoo?tab=repositories&type=source&sort=stargazers).

### Contact
If you have a question or problem for my attention, please consider tagging me in a public thread rather than sending an email or a forum DM. Just like open source code, open communication becomes a resource for others with similar needs.  
I do not support Bukkit plugins via instant messaging platforms. Please create an issue if you are experiencing difficulties.
