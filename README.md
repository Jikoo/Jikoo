### Hi there!

I'm a programmer with a career in CNC manufacturing. My focus is on Java, but I can work my way through other languages with relative ease as the need arises. I've worked with Bash, various SQL/NoSQL databases (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.), and dabbled in Python, C#, and more. I can write G-code manually when required, optimizing or redefining tool paths and programs. I've also done systems administration for several communities I helped manage over the years.

Out of all of my projects, I'm most proud of [EnchantableBlocks](https://github.com/Jikoo/EnchantableBlocks). It started off as a very basic implementation, but over the years it has matured with me. I keep coming back to it as I learn, using new tools to automate processes and ensure that I'm able to deliver a higher quality product. The work I put into reverse engineering Minecraft's internal systems for enchantment management led to splitting out [PlanarEnchanting](https://github.com/Jikoo/PlanarEnchanting) as a separate library, and my frustrations with configuration boilerplate and duplicate utility classes lead to [PlanarWrappers](https://github.com/Jikoo/PlanarWrappers). While many of my other projects lack the thorough test-centric design of EnchantableBlocks, I've started adapting the lessons I've learned to them over the years as time permits. There are always new techniques and ways to improve, it's definitely been the most fun I've had while programming.

I don't play Minecraft much any more, but I'm still active in the Spigot plugin development scene. In addition to [my own repositories](https://github.com/Jikoo?tab=repositories) I maintain [OpenInv](https://github.com/Jikoo/OpenInv), frequently contribute to [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention), and collaborate on [Treasury](https://github.com/lokka30/Treasury).
